# breakout
Breakout (implemented in funcSug)

This is just the same game as https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop/blob/gh-pages/lesson10.html but implemented in funcSug.
This is made so you can compare vanilla javascript and funcSug. 

You can test it at https://cl4cnam.github.io/breakout/breakout.html.
